# **Egg Prices Analysis Across Countries**

## **Introduction**

Eggs are a staple in many households worldwide. For this project, we explored the global prices of eggs and analyzed how they are influenced by an external factor: sales tax rates. This analysis allows us to understand price variations across countries and assess whether economic policies such as sales taxes significantly affect the cost of this essential product.

## **Steps and Analysis**

### **1. Importing Necessary Libraries**
```python
from datascience import *
import numpy as np

%matplotlib inline
import matplotlib.pyplot as plots
plots.style.use('fivethirtyeight')
```
*Motivation*: Setting up the environment with required libraries like `datascience`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib` for data manipulation and visualization.

### **2. Web Scraping Functions**
```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import pandas as pd
from IPython.core.display import display, HTML

def scrape_table(table):
    df = pd.read_html(str(table))
    df = pd.DataFrame(df[0])
    return Table.from_df(df)
```
*Motivation*: The `scrape_table` function is designed to extract HTML tables from web pages and convert them into pandas DataFrames for further processing.

### **3. Scraping Data**
```python
egg_price_url = "https://www.globalproductprices.com/rankings/egg_prices/"
tax_rate_url = "https://tradingeconomics.com/country-list/sales-tax-rate"
currency_url = "https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/glossary/currency-codes"
```
*Motivation*: These URLs provide data for egg prices, sales tax rates, and currency codes, which are essential for this analysis.

### **4. Cleaning and Preparing Data**
(Include brief explanation and code snippets for cleaning and aligning data like handling missing values, ensuring consistent currency conversions, etc.)

### **5. Visualizing Price Distributions**
```python
plots.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plots.hist(egg_prices.column('Price'), bins=20, alpha=0.7)
plots.title('Distribution of Egg Prices Worldwide')
plots.xlabel('Price (USD)')
plots.ylabel('Frequency')
plots.show()
```
*Graph*: Include the generated histogram.

## **External Factor Analysis**
(Explain the analysis performed to correlate sales tax rates with egg prices, including visualizations like scatter plots or correlation metrics.)

---

## **Conclusions**

1. **Most Expensive Country**: New Zealand
2. **Cheapest Country**: Zambia

### **Interesting Insights**
- (Highlight any trends or anomalies observed during the analysis, e.g., "Countries with higher GDPs tend to have lower egg prices despite higher sales tax rates.")
